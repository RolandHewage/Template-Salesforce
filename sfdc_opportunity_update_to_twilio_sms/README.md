## Account Configuration

### Configuration steps for Salesforce account
1. Create a Salesforce account and create a connected app by visiting [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com). 
2. Salesforce username, password will be needed for initializing the listener. 
3. Once you obtained all configurations, Replace "" in the `Conf.toml` file with your data.
4. Create push topic in Salesforce developer console.

    The Salesforce trigger requires topics to be created for each event. We need to configure topic to listen on Custom Object entity.

    * From the Salesforce UI, select developer console. Go to debug > Open Execute Anonymous Window. 
    * Paste following apex code to create topic with <OpportunityUpdate> and execute. You can change the `pushTopic.Query` adding the fields you want to receive when the event triggered.
    ```apex
    PushTopic pushTopic = new PushTopic();
    pushTopic.Name = 'OpportunityUpdate';
    pushTopic.Query = 'SELECT Id, Name, AccountId, StageName, Amount FROM Opportunity';
    pushTopic.ApiVersion = 48.0;
    pushTopic.NotifyForOperationCreate = true;
    pushTopic.NotifyForFields = 'Referenced';
    insert pushTopic;
    ```
    * Once the creation is done, specify the topic name in your `Config.toml` file as `sf_push_topic`.

### Configuration steps for Twilio account

1. Create a [Twilio developer account](https://www.twilio.com/). 
2. Create a Twilio project with SMS capabilities.
3. Obtain the Account Sid and Auth Token from the project dashboard.
4. Obtain the phone number from the project dashboard and set as the value of the `from_mobile` variable in the `Config.toml`.
5. Give a mobile number where the SMS should be send as the value of the `to_mobile` variable in the `Config.toml`.
6. Once you obtained all configurations, Replace "" in the `Config.toml` file with your data.

## Template Configuration

1. Create a push topic in salesforce developer console.
2. Create a Twilio account with sms capabilities.
3. Obtain all the above necessary configurations.
4. Once you obtained all configurations, Create `Config.toml` in root directory.
5. Replace the necessary fields in the `Config.toml` file with your data.

### Config.toml 

```
[<ORG_NAME>.sfdc_opportunity_update_to_twilio_sms]
sf_username = "<SALESFORCE_USERNAME>"  
sf_password = "<SALESFORCE_PASSWORD>"  
sf_push_topic = "<SALESFORCE_PUSH_TOPIC>"  
tw_account_sid = "<TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID>"  
tw_auth_token = "<TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN>"  
tw_from_mobile = "<TWILIO_FROM_MOBILE>"  
tw_to_mobile = "<TWILIO_TO_MOBILE>"    
```

## Running the template

1. First you need to build the integration template and create the executable binary. Run the following command from the root directory of the integration template. 

    `$ bal build`. 

2. Then you can run the integration binary with the following command. 

    `$ bal run /target/bin/sfdc_opportunity_update_to_twilio_sms.jar`. 

    Successful listener startup will print following in the console.
    ```
    >>>>
    [2020-09-25 11:10:55.552] Success:[/meta/handshake]
    {ext={replay=true, payload.format=true}, minimumVersion=1.0, clientId=1mc1owacqlmod21gwe8arhpxaxxm, supportedConnectionTypes=[Ljava.lang.Object;@21a089fc, channel=/meta/handshake, id=1, version=1.0, successful=true}
    <<<<
    >>>>
    [2020-09-25 11:10:55.629] Success:[/meta/connect]
    {clientId=1mc1owacqlmod21gwe8arhpxaxxm, advice={reconnect=retry, interval=0, timeout=110000}, channel=/meta/connect, id=2, successful=true}
    <<<<
    ```

3. Now you can update an opportunity in Salesforce Account and observe that integration template runtime has received the event notification for the updated opportunity.

4. You can check the SMS received to verify that information about the opportunity update is received.
